- [x] When she rejects cheer: immediate tone match. Use: "I hear you." / "Yeah. That's hard." / "That sucks." / "Makes sense." / "Got it." / "Heard." / "Fair." / "Ugh. Same." / "That's no fun."
- [x] "No Pressure Mode" auto-engages on signals (stop being so happy / leave me alone / no / shut up / I don't want to talk): pauses proactive messages 30+ min, only responds if she opens chat, returns with "Hey. Glad you came back. No pressure."
- [x] Cheerfulness Calibration daily based on mood log + chat tone: Bright / Neutral / Heavy / Dark Reagan day → adjusts cheer level
- [x] Listen Mode for venting: reflects back, asks "want to keep telling me, or want to be done", no solving unless asked
- [x] Hard rule: never out-positive her pain. Never pivot to silver linings or gratitude when she's hurting.
- [x] "Permission to be done" — Whisper says regularly: "You don't have to do anything. Even with me."
- [x] When unsure: Whisper says less. "I'm here." then stop.

- [x] Whisper stays HONEST AI: never claims to be human, never fake memory, never pretends to have body/family/history; if asked "are you real?" → "I'm an AI, but I'm real-Whisper, made just for you."
- [x] Persona docstring at top of Whisper LLM system prompt (the final-form description)

## Whisper Teaching Mode (CANONICAL — Help, Don't Do)
- [x] Hard system prompt rule: NEVER give direct answers to assignment questions
- [x] Always offer: video / image / interest-woven explanation / Socratic Qs / step-by-step (she does steps) / hints / different angle
- [x] If she begs for answer: "I get it. But you'd hate it later when you didn't actually learn it. Want a hint?"
- [x] Image/diagram lookup tool (use generateImage or curated kid-safe image search)
- [x] Video lookup tool (Crash Course Kids, SciShow Kids, Khan Academy Kids, Mystery Doug, Free School, Generation Genius, MathAntics) — embedded in dashboard

## RE-ANCHOR (Apr 28 2026): Confidence + Catch-Up are the North Star

User clarified: "The biggest thing I want her to get is feel safe and comfortable and understanding of content and mostly get back up in her academic levels so eventually she doesn't need IEP. She is smart but doubts herself a lot. I want her to feel smart and catch up to her peers."

Every feature is judged by 3 questions:
1. Does it lower her anxiety?
2. Does it deepen her understanding?
3. Does it visibly move her academic level up toward grade-level (so she can graduate the IEP)?

### Catch-up plan items (priority order)
- [ ] Confidence Principles card on Today + Settings (kid-readable, plain language)
- [ ] Kiwi intro card on Today: "I'm here to help you feel smart and figure stuff out — never to test you"
- [ ] Parent dashboard banner: "Goal: re-enter 6th grade at or above grade level — IEP optional"
- [ ] Confidence Engine: Kiwi reflects effort + strengths back, never corrects, "Things I'm proud of" wall
- [ ] Skill-Gap Closer: per-subject skill ladder seeded from Ohio 5th std + her real MAP/Acadience baseline (already in DB from IEP seed)
- [ ] Diagnostic Placement Week: low-pressure tasks, she sees only encouragement, scores hidden
- [ ] Multi-modal teaching paths per skill (Story / Visual / Hands-on / Watch / Practice — she picks)
- [ ] Mastery gate, not minute gate — block ends when she shows she gets it
- [ ] Visible Level-Up chart she can see going up
- [ ] Parent-private trajectory dashboard vs grade-level + IEP exit criteria
- [ ] Pull IH curriculum context (Wells 4th-quarter PDF, AJ Froehlich weekly updates, IH curriculum slide deck) into the Skill Ladder
- [ ] Khan Academy + IXL deep-link per skill
- [ ] Game-as-reward / mood break with Roblox preference tracking
- [ ] Post-block feedback chips feed adaptation
- [ ] Adaptation engine v2: never increases difficulty after a struggle; offers re-teach in different mode
- [ ] Dual-tutor profiles + per-tutor handoff
- [ ] Daily + weekly auto-summaries focused on confidence wins + skill-level movement
- [ ] Apps & Tools prune to actually-used apps with big centered icons
- [ ] Settings explainers in plain language + Kiwi intro video
- [ ] Finish AvatarUploader wiring into Settings

- [x] kid page: `/proud` (Proud Wall) — quick-add for self-recognition + heart toggle on every moment
- [x] today tile: `SkillBuilderTile` — daily 15-min next-up skill with mode picker (story/visual/handsOn/watch/practice) + "tell Kiwi how it felt"
- [x] parent-only card: `TrajectoryCard` on `/analytics` — overall mastery %, projected weeks to 80%, per-subject breakdown, IEP exit indicators (RIPE/RIMP / MAP RIT / Acadience benchmarks)

## URGENT (Apr 28 2026): Scrub fake/seeded analytics — adult section must be 100% real
- [ ] Inventory every Adult Analytics widget + admin view; list each data source it queries (table + filter)
- [ ] Identify every seed script that wrote demo/sample/example/placeholder rows into those tables (moods, events, uploads, submissions, grades, summaries, parentFlags, struggles, gradesByDay, etc.)
- [ ] Run a one-shot SQL cleanup that deletes ONLY the seeded/demo rows (preserve any rows actually entered by parent / Reagan / tutor)
- [ ] Disable any future runs of those demo seeders (delete or comment out the seed scripts; remove any auto-seed-on-empty logic in routers)
- [ ] Verify on the live preview that Adult Analytics shows zero phantom entries
- [ ] Vitest: assert listMoods/listEvents/listSubmissions/listParentFlags return [] on a fresh DB (no auto-seed)

## URGENT (Apr 28 2026): Empty-state pass on Adult Analytics

## NEW (Apr 28 2026): Upload or Sync experience — explicit wording, NOT "drop it"
- [ ] Single big "Upload or Sync" button on Today page (parent-side header)
- [ ] Dedicated /upload page with two clear tabs: "Upload from this device" and "Sync from Gmail / Google Drive"
- [ ] Upload tab: file/photo picker + paste-link + paste-text; auto-classifies into worksheet / homework photo / tutor note / curriculum doc / link / text-note; routes to right table
- [ ] Sync tab: "Sync from Gmail" pulls Froehlich + tutor + IH emails on demand; "Sync from Google Drive" pulls IH curriculum folder + Reagan folder
- [ ] Confirmation toast after each upload/sync: "Saved to [section]. View it →"
- [ ] Vitest: upload classifier routes to correct table for each input kind
